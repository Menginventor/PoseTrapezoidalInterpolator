# PoseTrapezoidalInterpolator
This library provides unified interpolation of 3D poses (position + orientation) using **synchronized trapezoidal velocity profiles**. Each segment is treated as a single motion with combined distance in position and orientation space, ensuring **smooth acceleration, cruising, and deceleration** in both translation and rotation.
